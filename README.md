# PolyJamerous

PolyJamerous is an interactive 3D soundscape explorer designed to map and visualize music genres and artists. By mapping artists across universal musical dimensions, it provides a dynamic, spatial way to discover and categorize music.

## Features

* **3D Soundscape Visualization:** Explore music genres in a spatial, three-dimensional grid.
* **Universal Musical Dimensions:** Artists and genres are categorized using core, universal musical dimensions applicable across all styles of music.
* **Intuitive UI:** Navigate the soundscape easily using clean, interactive pill-toggle controls to filter and adjust your view.

## Project Status

Active prototyping and development. Currently refining the visual grid, UI toggles, and mapping logic for artist categorization.
